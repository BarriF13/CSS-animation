    <h2 >My Fair Lady</h2>
    <p>
      Eliza Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed!
      My head's too light to try to set it down! Sleep! Sleep!
      I couldn't sleep tonight.
      Not for all the jewels in the crown!
      I could have danced all night!
      I could have danced all night!
      And still have begged for more.
      I could have spread my wings
      And done a thousand things I've never done before.
      I'll never know What made it so exciting;
      Why all at once My heart took flight. I only know when he
      Began to dance with me I could have danced,
      danced, danced all night!
      Servant 1 It's after three now.
      Servant 2 Don't you agree now,
      She ought to be in bed.
      Eliza I could have danced all night!</p>
