    <h1>Buenos Aires</h1>
    <h2>City of Argentine tango</h2>
    <p>Argentine tango is a musical genre and accompanying social dance originating at the end of the 19th century in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. It has continued to grow in popularity and spread internationally, adding modern elements without replacing the older ones.</p>
    <blockquote>Those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.
      <cite>Friedrich Nietzsche </cite>
